# React Admin + Prisma (Backend-Only Edition) 🛠️

> ✨ A simplified Prisma adapter for use with React Admin — now without bundling `react-admin` itself.

---

## ⚠️ Important Update

We have **removed the `react-admin` dependency** from this package to make it usable in **backend-only projects**.

- You can now integrate this with **any Node.js/NestJS/Express**.
- Ideal for building APIs that are compatible with React Admin, **without having React Admin installed on the server**.

---

## 💡 What This Is

A server-side utility to help your backend **speak the same language** as React Admin.

- Converts `react-admin`-style queries to Prisma calls.
- Provides a clean, pluggable handler for use in REST or RPC endpoints.
